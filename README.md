<p1>This is simple little Wave Sim I built.<p1>

<p1>We had an intern that was interested in physics, so I thought it would fun for them to play around with some -- hopefully -- easy to understand code<p1>

<p1>But twas I that ended up playing with it and neglecting work...<p1>

<p1>You can just copy and paste this into the online p5 editor and it should run.<p1>
